- API endpoint associated with each virtual screen for chatbot interaction.

### Virtual Screen Interaction

- Users can open virtual screens on multiple devices (e.g., iPad, Windows PC) via a browser.
- Chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT) can read from and write to these virtual screens via the provided API.

### API Integration for Chatbots
